		"Description": "A product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need by potential customers.    That product is the sum of all physical, psychological, symbolic, and service attributes associated with it.\n\nThere are two basic types of products:\n\n- Tangible (physical)\n- Intangible (non-physical) such as services\n\nA service is a non-material or intangible product - such as professional consultancy, maintenance service, repair service etc.\nEach product has its own benefits, application, brand name, and packaging that gives it its own identity and distinguishing characteristics.\n\nEvery business or organization has business rules that define precisely what a product is.    While we intuitively know what a product is, we must quantify that knowledge and associated business rules with consistent definitions that can be implemented within the organization in strategies and applications.\n\nA product typically goes through five stages of development:\n\n(1) Idea Stage - involving a thorough evaluation of the potential product\n\n(2) Concept Stage - determines customer acceptance by testing and presentation to consumers and distribution channel members.   Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\n\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\n\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\n\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\n\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\n\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\n\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Raw materials\n- Equipment\n- Pre-built materials \n- Supplies.\n\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\n\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Durable goods\n- Nondurable goods\n- Packaged goods\n\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\n\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\n\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\n\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\n\nEx:\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\n- Mac mini\n- MacBook Pro\n- Mac Pro\n\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\n\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\n\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\n\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\n\n3. To counter competitor's products\n\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\n\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\n\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\n\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\n\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\n\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\n\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\n\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\n\n\"Trading up or brand leveraging\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\n\"Trading down\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\n\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\n\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\n\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\n\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\n\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\n\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\n\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\n\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\n\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\n\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\n\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\n\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\n\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition purposes.",

					"Name": "BarCode",
					"Description": "The bar code for the associated pharmaceutical product.\n\nA bar code is a series of light and dark printed bars pre-established to represent alphabetic and numeric characters in any number of standard schemes.  When a wand or a laser  beam is run across the bars at a constant velocity, light is reflected from the bars and spaces in a series of pulses that can be electronically detected and converted into the appropriate characters.\n\nFDA Issues Bar Code Regulation\nFebruary 25, 2004\nToday's Action\nIn an effort to improve patient safety in the hospital setting by reducing medication errors, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published a final rule titled, Bar Code Label Requirements for Human Drug Products and Biological Products.\n\nThe Final Rule \nFDA is issuing a final rule that requires \"bar codes\" on most prescription drugs and on certain over-the-counter drugs. Bar codes are symbols consisting of horizontal lines and spaces and are commonly seen on most consumer goods. In retail settings, bar codes identify the specific product and allow software to link the product to price and other sales- and inventory-related information. FDA's bar code rule uses bar codes to address an important public health concern -- medication errors associated with drug products. \n\nHow Would It Work\nThe final rule requires linear bar codes on most prescription drugs and on over-the-counter drugs commonly used in hospitals and dispensed pursuant to an order. The bar code must, at a minimum, contain the drug's National Drug Code (NDC) number, which uniquely identifies the drug. \n\nFor blood and blood components intended for transfusion, the final rule requires the use of machine-readable information in a format approved for use by FDA. The machine-readable information must include, at a minimum, the facility identifier, the lot number relating to the donor, the product code, and the donor's ABO and Rh. \n\nBar codes on drugs would help prevent medication errors when used with a bar code scanning system and computerized database. This system would work as follows:\n\nA patient is admitted to the hospital. The hospital gives the patient a bar-coded identification bracelet to link the patient to his or her computerized medical record. \nAs required by the rule, most prescription drugs and certain over-the-counter drugs would have a bar code on their labels. The bar code would reflect the drug's NDC number. \nThe hospital would have bar code scanners or readers that are linked to the hospital's computer system of electronic medical records. \nBefore a healthcare worker administers a drug to the patient, the healthcare worker scans the patient's bar code. This allows the computer to pull up the patient's computerized medical record. \nThe healthcare worker then scans the drug(s) that the hospital pharmacy has provided to be administered to the patient. This scan informs the computer which drug is being administered. \nThe computer then compares the patient's medical record to the drug(s) being administered to ensure that they match. If there is a problem, the computer sends an error message, and the healthcare worker investigates the problem. \nThe problem could be one of many things: \nWrong patient \nWrong dose of drug \nWrong drug \nWrong time to administer the drug \nThe patient's chart has been updated and the prescribed medication has changed \nSo, for example, a bar code system could prevent a child from receiving an adult dosage of a drug and prevent a patient from mistakenly receiving a duplicate dose of a drug he or she had already received. A bar code system can also allow the computer to record the time that the patient receives the drug, ensuring more accurate medical records. \n\nImproving Patient Safety\nThe Institute of Medicine and other expert bodies have concluded that medical errors have substantial costs in lives, injuries, and wasted health care resources, and that drug-related adverse events are a major component of those errors. \n\nFDA estimates that the bar code rule, once implemented, will result in more than 500,000 fewer adverse events over the next 20 years. Thus, FDA estimates a 50% reduction in medication errors that would otherwise occur when drugs are dispensed or administered, even though some hospitals that currently have bar code systems in place report a higher error reduction from bar code usage. \n\nOther Benefits\nPatients would avoid pain, suffering, and extensions of hospital stays with an estimated value of $93 billion over the next 20 years. In addition, hospitals are expected to avoid litigation associated with preventable adverse events, reduce malpractice liability insurance premiums, and increase receipts from more accurate billing procedures. \n\nAlso, the bar coding system could help with inventory control for drug manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacists, as well as efficiencies in ordering and billing.",

While we intuitively know what a product is, we must quantify that knowledge and associated business rules with consistent definitions that can be implemented within the organization in strategies and applications.\\n\\nA product typically goes through five stages of development:\\n\\n(1) Idea Stage - involving a thorough evaluation of the potential product\\n\\n(2) Concept Stage - determines customer acceptance by testing and presentation to consumers and distribution channel members.   Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\\n\\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\\n\\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\\n\\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\\n\\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\\n\\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\\n\\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\\n\\n- Raw materials\\n- Equipment\\n- Pre-built materials \\n- Supplies.\\n\\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\\n\\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\\n\\n- Durable goods\\n- Nondurable goods\\n- Packaged goods\\n\\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\\n\\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\\n\\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\\n\\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\\n\\nEx:\\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\\n- Mac mini\\n- MacBook Pro\\n- Mac Pro\\n\\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\\n\\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\\n\\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\\n\\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\\n\\n3. To counter competitor's products\\n\\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\\n\\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\\n\\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\\n\\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\\n\\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\\n\\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\\n\\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\\n\\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\\n\\n\\\"Trading up or brand leveraging\\\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\\n\\n\\\"Trading down\\\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\\n\\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\\n\\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\\n\\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\\n\\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\\n\\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\\n\\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\\n\\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\\n\\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\\n\\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\\n\\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\\n\\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\\n\\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\\n\\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\\n\\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition

Bar codes are symbols consisting of horizontal lines and spaces and are commonly seen on most consumer goods. In retail settings, bar codes identify the specific product and allow software to link the product to price and other sales- and inventory-related information. FDA's bar code rule uses bar codes to address an important public health concern -- medication errors associated with drug products. \\n\\nHow Would It Work\\nThe final rule requires linear bar codes on most prescription drugs and on over-the-counter drugs commonly used in hospitals and dispensed pursuant to an order. The bar code must, at a minimum, contain the drug's National Drug Code (NDC) number, which uniquely identifies the drug. \\n\\nFor blood and blood components intended for transfusion, the final rule requires the use of machine-readable information in a format approved for use by FDA. The machine-readable information must include, at a minimum, the facility identifier, the lot number relating to the donor, the product code, and the donor's ABO and Rh. \\n\\nBar codes on drugs would help prevent medication errors when used with a bar code scanning system and computerized database. This system would work as follows:\\n\\nA patient is admitted to the hospital. The hospital gives the patient a bar-coded identification bracelet to link the patient to his or her computerized medical record. \\nAs required by the rule, most prescription drugs and certain over-the-counter drugs would have a bar code on their labels. The bar code would reflect the drug's NDC number. \\nThe hospital would have bar code scanners or readers that are linked to the hospital's computer system of electronic medical records. \\nBefore a healthcare worker administers a drug to the patient, the healthcare worker scans the patient's bar code. This allows the computer to pull up the patient's computerized medical record. \\nThe healthcare worker then scans the drug(s) that the hospital pharmacy has provided to be administered to the patient. This scan informs the computer which drug is being administered. \\nThe computer then compares the patient's medical record to the drug(s) being administered to ensure that they match. If there is a problem, the computer sends an error message, and the healthcare worker investigates the problem. \\nThe problem could be one of many things: \\nWrong patient \\nWrong dose of drug \\nWrong drug \\nWrong time to administer the drug \\nThe patient's chart has been updated and the prescribed medication has changed \\nSo, for example, a bar code system could prevent a child from receiving an adult dosage of a drug and prevent a patient from mistakenly receiving a duplicate dose of a drug he or she had already received. A bar code system can also allow the computer to record the time that the patient receives the drug, ensuring more accurate medical records. \\n\\nImproving Patient Safety\\nThe Institute of Medicine and other expert bodies have concluded that medical errors have substantial costs in lives, injuries, and wasted health care resources, and that drug-related adverse events are a major component of those errors. \\n\\nFDA estimates that the bar code rule, once implemented, will result in more than 500,000 fewer adverse events over the next 20 years. Thus, FDA estimates a 50% reduction in medication errors that would otherwise occur when drugs are dispensed or administered, even though some hospitals that currently have bar code systems in place report a higher error reduction from bar code usage. \\n\\nOther Benefits\\nPatients would avoid pain, suffering, and extensions of hospital stays with an estimated value of $93 billion over the next 20 years. In addition, hospitals are expected to avoid litigation associated with preventable adverse events, reduce malpractice liability insurance premiums, and increase receipts from more accurate billing procedures. \\n\\nAlso, the bar coding system could help with inventory control for drug manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacists, as well as efficiencies in ordering and billing.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"BarCode\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"PharmaProduct.cdm.json/PharmaProduct\",\"name\":\"InformationLabelText\"},\"dataType\":\"string\",\"dataTypeLength\":1024,\"description\":\"The

Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\n\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\n\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\n\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\n\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\n\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\n\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Raw materials\n- Equipment\n- Pre-built materials \n- Supplies.\n\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\n\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Durable goods\n- Nondurable goods\n- Packaged goods\n\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\n\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\n\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\n\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\n\nEx:\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\n- Mac mini\n- MacBook Pro\n- Mac Pro\n\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\n\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\n\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\n\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\n\n3. To counter competitor's products\n\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\n\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\n\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\n\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\n\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\n\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\n\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\n\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\n\n\"Trading up or brand leveraging\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\n\"Trading down\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\n\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\n\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\n\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\n\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\n\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\n\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\n\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\n\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\n\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\n\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\n\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\n\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\n\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition purposes.",
